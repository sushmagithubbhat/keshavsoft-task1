# KeshavSoft Internship - Task 1

This project was built as part of my internship at **KeshavSoft**.  
The goal was to **explore Bootstrap 5 official examples**, extract modern UI components, and remix them into clean, creative HTML pages.

---

 Goal
- Practice building modern UI layouts using **Bootstrap 5, HTML5, CSS3**
- Learn how to combine components like **Navbars, Hero sections, Cards, Album, Pricing, and Footers**
- Push project to **GitHub** and deploy using **GitHub Pages**
- Avoid copy–pasting full Bootstrap example pages, instead **extract and remix** components for a custom look

#Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Bootstrap 5** (via CDN)
- **GitHub** (for version control & hosting)
